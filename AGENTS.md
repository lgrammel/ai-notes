# Agent Instructions

This repository is a lightweight knowledge base of my notes on **AI** and **security for AI systems**. The content is intentionally short and “definition-first”: each note captures a concept, role, or practice in a way that’s easy to reference while designing, building, or reviewing AI products.

## What you’ll find here

- **`concepts/`**: bite-sized markdown notes defining core terms (e.g. LLMs, evals, fine-tuning, inference providers, observability/telemetry).
- **Occasional artifacts**: as the repo grows, it may also include small scripts, JSON, or other files that support the notes (examples, snippets, checklists, etc.).

## How to use it

- Skim `concepts/` when you need a quick refresher or a shared definition for a discussion/design doc.
- Treat the notes as a living glossary: update entries when your understanding changes or new best practices emerge.

## Conventions for new notes

- Keep notes **short** and **practical** (one screen when possible).
- Prefer **clear definitions** plus 1–2 sentences on why it matters in production.
- When relevant, connect concepts (e.g. how **telemetry** feeds **evals**, how **evals** gate releases, how **observability** catches regressions).
