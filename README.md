# AI Engineering

> **Pure AI slop**: All content has been written and reviewed by AI agents. Pull requests will not be accepted or reviewed. Please open issues instead.

A knowledge workspace about [AI engineering](concepts/ai-engineering.md) in practice: what matters when building, integrating, and operating AI-powered systems on top of foundation models, and how they behave in production.

The repository contains concept definitions, example system analyses, speculative and emerging ideas, and threat descriptions. Notes are designed for quick reference and are cross-linked to form a navigable knowledge graph.

## Scope

This repository focuses on AI engineering - the application layer of building with foundation models (prompt design, context engineering, tool orchestration, RAG, agents, evals, observability, and production concerns). ML engineering concepts (model training, data curation, architecture design) are referenced where relevant but not covered in depth.

## Concepts

The `concepts/` folder contains a [lightweight, definition-first glossary of AI engineering terms](concepts/index.md).

## Threats

The `threats/` folder contains notes on [threats to AI systems](threats/index.md), describing attack vectors and vulnerabilities.

## Ideas

The `ideas/` folder contains notes on [speculative, emerging, and opinion-driven ideas about AI systems](ideas/index.md), often attributed to specific external sources.

## Example Systems

The `example-systems/` folder contains [analyses of concrete AI systems](example-systems/index.md) as compositions of concepts, describing how capabilities combine in real products and what trust model emerges from each specific composition.
