# AI Engineering

A knowledge workspace about [AI engineering](concepts/ai-engineering.md) in practice: what matters when building, integrating, and operating AI-powered systems on top of foundation models, and how they behave in production.

The repository contains concept definitions, exploratory ideas and observations, and threats. Notes are designed for quick reference and are cross-linked to form a navigable knowledge graph.

**Scope:** This repository focuses on AI engineering -- the application layer of building with foundation models (prompt design, context engineering, tool orchestration, RAG, agents, evals, observability, and production concerns). ML engineering concepts (model training, data curation, architecture design) are referenced where relevant but not covered in depth.

> **Read-only repository**: Pull requests will not be accepted or reviewed.

## Concepts

The `concepts/` folder contains a [lightweight, definition-first glossary for AI terms](concepts/index.md) used throughout this repo.

## Ideas

The `ideas/` folder contains notes on [speculative and emerging ideas about AI systems](ideas/index.md), attributed to specific external sources.

## Threats

The `threats/` folder contains notes on [threats to AI agent systems](threats/index.md), describing attack vectors and vulnerabilities relevant to AI agents.
