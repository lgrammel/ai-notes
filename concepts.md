This file contains a glossary of concepts.

## Large Language Model (LLM, Model)

A Large Language Model is a neural network trained to predict the next token using large text (and sometimes multimodal) datasets. It can generate and transform text and is commonly used in chatbots and AI agents.

## Fine-tuning

Further training of an existing model on a narrower dataset to change or improve its behavior (for example instruction-following, style, safety, or domain expertise). Fine-tuning is typically cheaper than pretraining from scratch.

## Model Developer (Model Creator)

An organization that develops model weights via pretraining and/or further training (for example fine-tuning or distillation). The resulting models can be proprietary or open-weight.

## Inference Provider

An organization that runs models to generate outputs (inference) and exposes them via an API or hosted service. It may serve its own models or third-party models.

Note: many organizations are both model developers and inference providers; these are roles, not mutually exclusive categories.
