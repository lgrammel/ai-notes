# Agent

An agent is a system that uses an [LLM](./llm.md) as a decision-making policy to run [tools](./tools.md) in a loop: observe context/state, choose an action (tool call or message), execute it, incorporate the result, and repeat until a stop condition is met.

This loop is typically implemented and operated by an [agent runtime](./agent-runtime.md).

Some agents are [workspace agents](./workspace-agent.md), meaning their tool use is centered on a longer-lived project/workspace state (often a filesystem in a sandbox).

Agents are often exposed to users through a [chatbot](./chatbot.md) interface, but "agent" describes the backend behavior (a tool-using loop) rather than the UI; an agent can also run via an API, a background job, or an event-driven workflow without an interactive chat surface.

The combination of LLM-driven decisions and real-world tool access makes agents susceptible to a range of [threats](../threats/index.md) including [prompt injection](../threats/prompt-injection.md), [tool misuse](../threats/tool-misuse.md), and [data exfiltration](../threats/data-exfiltration.md).
