# AI Agent

Synonyms: LLM agent, tool-using agent (sometimes "autonomous agent").

An AI agent is a system that uses an [LLM](./large-language-model.md) as a decision-making policy to run **tools** in a loop: observe context/state, choose an action (tool call or message), execute it, incorporate the result, and repeat until a stop condition is met.
