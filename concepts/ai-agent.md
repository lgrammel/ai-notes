# AI Agent

Synonyms: LLM agent, tool-using agent (sometimes "autonomous agent").

An AI agent is a system that uses an [LLM](./large-language-model.md) as a decision-making policy to run **tools** in a loop: observe context/state, choose an action (tool call or message), execute it, incorporate the result, and repeat until a stop condition is met.

Why it matters: agents turn models from "text in, text out" into systems that can take multi-step actions in software and the real world--so reliability, security boundaries, and operational controls matter as much as model quality.
