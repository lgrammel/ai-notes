# AI Infrastructure

Infrastructure built or adapted to support AI systems in production (especially [LLM](./large-language-model.md)- and [agent](./ai-agent.md)-based use cases).

Examples: model hosting, [AI gateways](./ai-gateway.md), [AI observability](./observability-tools.md), AI search/RAG infrastructure, [eval runners](./evaluations-evals.md), [sandboxes](./sandbox.md) (local or as-a-service), durable [agent](./ai-agent.md) execution.
