# Chatbot

Synonyms: chat assistant, conversational assistant (product terms).

A chatbot is an application that provides a conversational interface (chat) for users to ask questions or request actions, producing responses over one or more turns using an [LLM](./large-language-model.md). In practice, chatbots often use retrieval (RAG), tools, and guardrails to answer more reliably and safely.

Note: a chatbot is a UI pattern and product surface; it may or may not be an [AI agent](./ai-agent.md) (which implies tool use in a loop).

Examples: customer support chat, an internal IT helpdesk bot, a "docs Q&A" assistant.
