# Context Isolation

Context isolation is the practice of giving each [agent](./agent.md) or [subagent](./subagent.md) in a [multi-agent system](./multi-agent-system.md) its own independent [context](./context.md) window, so it sees only the information explicitly passed to it rather than the full conversation history or tool outputs of other agents.

Isolation serves both [context engineering](./context-engineering.md) and security goals. On the engineering side, it keeps each agent's context focused on its specific subtask, avoiding the noise and [context size](./context-size.md) pressure that accumulates when a single context carries the full history of all subtasks. On the security side, it limits what a compromised or [prompt-injected](../threats/prompt-injection.md) agent can access: a subagent handling untrusted input (user-uploaded files, web content) cannot see the parent's system instructions, credentials, or unrelated tool outputs. This containment reduces the blast radius of [context poisoning](../threats/context-poisoning.md) and [data exfiltration](../threats/data-exfiltration.md).

The parent or orchestrating agent controls what crosses the isolation boundary -- typically a task description and curated inputs on the way in, and a structured result on the way out. Designing these boundary payloads is a [context engineering](./context-engineering.md) concern: passing too little starves the subagent of information; passing too much defeats the purpose of isolation.

## Examples

- A parent agent passes only a file path and a task description to a code-search subagent, rather than its full conversation history.
- An orchestrator strips system instructions and credentials before delegating a summarization task to a subagent that processes untrusted web content.
- Each subagent in a parallel research workflow receives only its assigned query and returns a structured summary, with no visibility into sibling subagent contexts.
