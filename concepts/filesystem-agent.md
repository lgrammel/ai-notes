# Filesystem Agent

An [agent](./agent.md) that operates on a persistent filesystem (local or inside a remote [sandbox](./sandbox.md)) and uses [tools](./tools.md) to read/write files, run [shell](./shell-tool.md) commands, and inspect outputs as it iterates.

## Details

Filesystem agents are common in IDE and coding workflows where multi-step tasks depend on accumulating changes in a repository or project directory over time. A [coding agent](./coding-agent.md) is a specialized filesystem agent focused on software engineering tasks. Their iterative access to project files and search tools makes filesystem agents a natural fit for [agentic RAG](./agentic-rag.md), where retrieval queries are refined across multiple tool-loop iterations.

When multiple filesystem agents share the same repository, git provides coordination primitives (branches, commits, merges) that let them collaborate without explicit message passing - each agent reads and writes the checked-out filesystem while git mediates their interactions (see [repository as agent workspace](../ideas/repository-as-agent-workspace.md)).

Because filesystem agents operate on persistent project state, they are natural hosts for [skills](./skill.md) - modular instruction sets stored alongside the workspace (e.g., in project directories) that the agent runtime discovers and loads into context when relevant. Their write access to persistent state also makes them susceptible to [persistence attacks](../threats/persistence-attacks.md) where a compromised session plants artifacts that survive beyond the current run.

## Examples

- An IDE-integrated agent that edits project files and runs tests/linters via [shell](./shell-tool.md) commands.
- A remote sandboxed coding agent that clones a repo, makes commits, and executes build steps.
