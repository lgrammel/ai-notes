# Observability Tools

Tools and practices for understanding and operating AI systems in production by collecting and correlating signals like logs (e.g., prompts/outputs), traces, metrics, model/version metadata, and user feedback—so you can debug issues, detect drift, and manage cost, latency, and safety.

Telemetry is a core input to observability: it provides the raw material for evals (representative inputs, edge cases, and feedback) and speeds up debugging via traces and error analysis. After changes (including fine-tuning), observability helps validate real-world impact and catch regressions or drift over time.
