# Sandbox Service

A sandbox service is a hosted service (usually exposed via an API) that provisions and manages [sandboxes](./sandbox.md) on demand and provides primitives to run commands/code, read/write files, and stream logs.

## Details

Sandbox services typically add lifecycle management (create/destroy, pooling), prebuilt images/templates, workspace mounting/sync, secrets injection, network controls, timeouts/[quotas](./quota-management.md), snapshotting, and [observability](./observability.md) hooks.

They are commonly used to run remote [filesystem agents](./filesystem-agent.md) that need a longer-lived project directory and controlled tool execution.
