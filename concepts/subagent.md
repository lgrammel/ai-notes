# Subagent

A subagent is an [agent](./agent.md) spawned by a parent agent to handle a delegated subtask, then return a result that the parent incorporates and continues with.

## Details

The parent agent defines the subagent's task, selects its [tools](./tools.md) and permissions, and provides an initial [context](./context.md) -- typically a task description plus relevant excerpts rather than the parent's full context. This scoping is a form of [context isolation](./context-isolation.md): each subagent operates in its own context window, seeing only what was explicitly passed to it. The parent-child relationship distinguishes subagents from peer agents in a [multi-agent system](./multi-agent-system.md); subagents are hierarchically controlled rather than independently coordinated.

Subagents enable decomposition of complex tasks: the parent handles planning and integration while subagents execute focused subtasks (code search, file editing, research, testing). Because each subagent runs with a fresh context window, it avoids the context bloat that would result from running all subtasks sequentially in a single agent loop. Different subagents can use different [LLM](./llm.md) backends ([model routing](./model-routing.md)), and their permissions can be scoped narrower than the parent's, limiting the blast radius of [tool misuse](../threats/tool-misuse.md) or [prompt injection](../threats/prompt-injection.md).

## Examples

- A coding agent that spawns a search subagent to find relevant files, then uses the results to make targeted edits in the parent context.
- An orchestrator agent that delegates independent subtasks to parallel subagents and synthesizes their outputs into a final result.
- A research agent that spawns a subagent with browser tools to fetch and summarize a web page, receiving only the summary back.
