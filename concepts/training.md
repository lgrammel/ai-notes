# Training

Training is the process of learning or updating a model's parameters (weights) from data by optimizing an objective (loss), typically using gradient-based methods. It is primarily an [ML engineering](./ml-engineering.md) concern; [AI engineering](./ai-engineering.md) consumes trained models rather than producing them.

## Details

Training updates model weights; [inference](./inference.md) uses them as-is. This distinction is fundamental to [AI engineering](./ai-engineering.md): AI engineers work at inference time with models whose behavior was shaped during training, and understanding the training pipeline helps explain why models behave as they do.

Training encompasses [pretraining](./pretraining.md) (learning general representations from broad data), [post-training](./post-training.md) phases such as [fine-tuning](./fine-tuning.md) and [reinforcement learning](./reinforcement-learning.md), and [alignment](./alignment.md) work. Training data can include [synthetic data](./synthetic-data.md) generated by other models. Capabilities like [tool](./tools.md) calling and [instruction following](./instruction-following.md) are established or refined during training.
