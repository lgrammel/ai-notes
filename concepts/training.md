# Training

Training is the process of learning or updating a model's parameters (weights) from data by optimizing an objective (loss), typically using gradient-based methods such as backpropagation.

In LLM systems, training includes large-scale pretraining as well as further training such as [fine-tuning](./fine-tuning.md); the result of training is a [model](./model.md) that can later be run during [inference](./inference.md).

## Examples

- Pretraining an LLM on large corpora to learn general language patterns
- Instruction fine-tuning a base model to follow a specific format or policy

## Synonyms

model training, optimization
