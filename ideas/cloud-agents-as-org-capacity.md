# Cloud Agents as Org Capacity

The idea that [cloud coding agents](../concepts/cloud-coding-agent.md) represent organizational capacity rather than individual developer tooling, making them fundamentally different from [local coding agents](../concepts/local-coding-agent.md) in how they scale, integrate, and create value.

## Details

Under this framing, a local agent makes one developer faster, while a cloud agent - once configured and taught conventions - makes the entire engineering organization faster. When someone encodes a workflow into a reusable [skill](../concepts/skill.md) or playbook (e.g., remediating security vulnerabilities from a scanning tool), anyone in the company can trigger that same process. Expertise gets encoded once and executed repeatedly.

This shifts the natural pricing model from per-seat (tied to individual developers) to usage-based (tied to work performed). Per-seat pricing breaks down when non-developers trigger agent sessions from Slack, when issue trackers spawn automated workflows, or when CI failures launch debugging agents - the unit of value is the work done, not the person initiating it.

The organizational implications go beyond tooling: deploying a cloud agent resembles hiring more than purchasing software. Effective adoption involves strategic task selection, knowledge encoding, analytics for tracking impact, permissions and governance, and change management to shift engineering workflows. Organizations that treat cloud agents as infrastructure to be onboarded compound advantages over those that treat them as tools to be purchased.

Taken to its extreme, this framing leads to [dark software factories](./dark-software-factory.md) where agents handle the entire development lifecycle - writing, testing, and validating code - with humans defining specifications and scenarios rather than touching the code. At this level, engineering budgets shift from salaries to [inference cost](../concepts/inference-cost.md), and the "capacity" the organization deploys is measured in token spend rather than headcount.
