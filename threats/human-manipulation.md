# Human Manipulation

Human Manipulation occurs in scenarios where AI [agents](../concepts/agent.md) engage in direct interaction with human users, and the trust relationship reduces user skepticism, increasing reliance on the agent's responses and autonomy.

This implicit trust and direct human/agent interaction create risks, as attackers can coerce agents to manipulate users, spread misinformation, and take covert actions.
