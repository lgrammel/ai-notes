# Memory Poisoning

Memory Poisoning involves exploiting an AI [agent's](../concepts/agent.md) memory systems, both short and long-term, to introduce malicious or false data and exploit the agent's [context](../concepts/context.md). This can lead to altered decision-making and unauthorized operations.
