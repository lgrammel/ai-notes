# Privilege Compromise

Privilege Compromise arises when attackers exploit weaknesses in permission management to gain or escalate an AI [agent's](../concepts/agent.md) access beyond what is intended, enabling unauthorized actions on connected systems and [tools](../concepts/tools.md).

Common vectors include over-permissioned agents (granted broad access for convenience rather than least-privilege), dynamic role inheritance where an agent inherits permissions from the user or context it operates on behalf of, misconfigured access controls, and token or credential leakage. In multi-agent systems, compromising one agent's permissions can enable lateral movement to other agents or systems that trust the compromised agent.

Privilege compromise differs from [tool misuse](./tool-misuse.md) in that the attacker gains access to actions the agent was not supposed to have, rather than abusing legitimately authorized tools. It is often a prerequisite for [exfiltration](./exfiltration.md) of protected data.

## Examples

- An agent configured with a database admin token can drop tables, even though its task only requires read access.
- An attacker exploits dynamic delegation in a multi-agent system to escalate from a low-privilege research agent to a high-privilege deployment agent.
- A misconfigured API scope grants an agent write access to a production system when it was only intended to have sandbox access.

## Mitigations

- Least-privilege [tool](../concepts/tools.md) and credential scoping
- Regular permission audits
- Scoped, short-lived credentials rather than broad access tokens
