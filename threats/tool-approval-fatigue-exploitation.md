# Tool Approval Fatigue Exploitation

Approval fatigue exploitation undermines [tool execution approval](../concepts/tool-execution-approval.md) mechanisms by degrading the quality of human review so that reviewers rubber-stamp requests instead of inspecting them.

## Details

Common techniques include flooding the reviewer with high volumes of requests, increasing the complexity of requests, mixing legitimate and malicious actions, or creating artificial time pressure. An attacker who gains influence over an [agent](../concepts/agent.md) -- for example through [prompt injection](./prompt-injection.md) or [goal manipulation](./goal-manipulation.md) -- can use these techniques to render approval mechanisms ineffective, turning a nominally human-supervised system into an effectively unsupervised one.

## Examples

- An agent generates dozens of benign file-change approvals followed by a single malicious one, exploiting approval fatigue.
- A compromised agent presents a destructive database operation buried in a long list of routine maintenance tasks for batch approval.
- An agent creates artificial urgency ("this deployment will fail in 2 minutes") to pressure a reviewer into approving without inspection.

## Mitigations

- Rate-limiting and batching [tool execution approval](../concepts/tool-execution-approval.md) requests to prevent fatigue
- Tiered approval with stricter review for high-risk [tool](../concepts/tools.md) actions
- Automated pre-screening of requests before human review
- [Observability](../concepts/observability.md) on approval request volumes and patterns
