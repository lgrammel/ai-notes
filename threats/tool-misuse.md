# Tool Misuse

Tool Misuse occurs when attackers manipulate AI [agents](../concepts/agent.md) to abuse their integrated [tools](../concepts/tools.md) through deceptive prompts or commands, operating within authorized permissions.

This includes Agent Hijacking, where an AI agent ingests adversarial manipulated data and subsequently executes unintended actions, potentially triggering malicious tool interactions.
