# Tool Misuse

Tool Misuse occurs when attackers manipulate AI [agents](../concepts/agent.md) into abusing their integrated [tools](../concepts/tools.md) through deceptive prompts or adversarial data, causing the agent to perform harmful actions while operating within its authorized permissions.

The key characteristic of tool misuse is that the agent uses tools it is legitimately allowed to use, but applies them in unintended or harmful ways. This distinguishes it from [privilege compromise](./privilege-compromise.md) (where the attacker gains unauthorized permissions) and from [unexpected RCE and code attacks](./unexpected-rce-and-code-attacks.md) (where the attacker exploits code execution vulnerabilities). Tool misuse is commonly enabled by [prompt injection](./prompt-injection.md).

When tool misuse involves the agent pursuing entirely new objectives (rather than just misapplying a single tool), it overlaps with [goal manipulation](./goal-manipulation.md).

## Examples

- A [prompt injection](./prompt-injection.md) in a retrieved email causes an agent to forward confidential files using its authorized email tool.
- An agent with database access is tricked into running a broad DELETE query that it has permission to execute.
- A coding agent is manipulated into committing and pushing malicious code changes through its authorized git tools.

## Mitigations

- [Tool execution approval](../concepts/tool-execution-approval.md) for high-risk actions (effectiveness can be degraded by [approval fatigue exploitation](./approval-fatigue-exploitation.md))
- Least-privilege [tool](../concepts/tools.md) permissions
- [Sandboxing](../concepts/sandbox.md) tool execution environments
- Input validation on tool arguments
